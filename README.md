# BINANCE-MARKET-LIMIT
!["market limit" button from this extension on Binance](preview.png) \

Quickly close position using limit order with current price without manually entering current price into limit input field. \
Sometimes when slippage is really high I don't think I can trust

so I created following extension to experiment with it.
